## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _a list `answer` of size `2` where_:

- _`answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are **not** present in `nums2`._
- _`answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are **not** present in `nums1`._

**Note** that the integers in the lists may be returned in **any** order.

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} nums1.length, nums2.length {"<="} 1000
  </code>
- <code>
    -1000 {"<="} nums1[i], nums2[i] {"<="} 1000
  </code>

<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
Output: [[3],[]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[2] and nums1[3] are not present in nums2. Since nums1[2] == nums1[3], their value is only included once and answer[0] = [3].
Every integer in nums2 is present in nums1. Therefore, answer[1] = [].

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    set1 = set(nums1)
    set2 = set(nums2)
    return [[num for num in set1 if num not in set2], [num for num in set2 if num not in set1]]
```
