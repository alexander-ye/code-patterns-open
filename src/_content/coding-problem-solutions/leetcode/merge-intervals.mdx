## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} intervals.length {"<="} 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- <code>
    0 {"<="} start<sub>i</sub> {"<="} end<sub>i</sub> {"<="} 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    intervals.sort(key =lambda x: x[0])
    merged =[]
    for interval in intervals:
      # if merged list is empty or current interval does not overlap with previous
      # append interval to merged list.
      if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
        merged.append(interval)
      # otherwise there is an overlap, so merge current and previous intervals
      else:
        merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```
