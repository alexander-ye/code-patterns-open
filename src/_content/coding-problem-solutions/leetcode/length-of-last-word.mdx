Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return _the length of the last word in the string_.

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

(A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.)

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} s.length {"<="} 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
    splitString = s.strip().split(" ")
    return len(splitString[len(splitString) - 1])
```
