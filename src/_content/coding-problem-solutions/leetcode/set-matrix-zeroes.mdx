## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`'s.

You must do it in place.

**Follow up:**

- A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

**Constraints**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[0].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- <code>
    -2<sup>31</sup> {"<="} matrix[i][j] {"<="} 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
  </code>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
```

## Solution

<CodeTabs>

```python
class Solution:
  def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
    """
    # Number of rows in the matrix
    m = len(matrix)
    # Number of columns in the matrix
    n = len(matrix[0])

    # For each row index of the matrix
    for i in range(m):
      # For each column index of the matrix
      for j in range(n):
        # If we find a zero
        if matrix[i][j] == 0:
          # Mark all numbers in the same row as 'zero'
          for inner_i in range(m):
            # We want to preserve existing zeroes so we can find them and 
            # mark their associated rows/columns in future iterations
            if matrix[inner_i][j] != 0:
              # We mark using a string instead of an integer to avoid false positives in our rewriting phase
              matrix[inner_i][j] = 'zero'
          # Mark all numbers in the same column as 'zero'
          for inner_j in range(n):
            # Again, preserve existing zeroes so we can mark their associated rows/columns in future iterations
            if matrix[i][inner_j] != 0:
              matrix[i][inner_j] = 'zero'

    # Rewrite the matrix to set the marked 'zeroes' to 0's
    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'zero':
          matrix[i][j] = 0
    
    # Per the problem statement, no return statement; we modify the matrix in-place
```
