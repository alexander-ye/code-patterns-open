## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

In English, we have a concept called **root**, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **successor**. For example, when the **root** `"an"` is followed by the **successor** word `"other"`, we can form a new word `"another"`.

Given a `dictionary` consisting of many roots and a `sentence` consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the **successors** in the sentence with the **root** forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one **root**, replace it with the **root** that has **the shortest length**.

Return the `sentence` after the replacement.

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} dictionary.length {"<="} 1000
  </code>
- <code>
    1 {"<="} dictionary[i].length {"<="} 100
  </code>
- `dictionary[i]` consists of only lower-case letters.
- <code>
    1 {"<="} sentence.length {"<="} 10<sup>6</sup>
  </code>
- `sentence` consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
- The number of words in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- The length of each word in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- Every two consecutive words in `sentence` will be separated by exactly one space.
- `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.

<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"
```

## Solution: Set and Loops

```python
class Solution:
  def replaceWords(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
    dictionary = set(dictionary)
    replacements = []
    for word in words:
      root = word
      for i in range(len(word)):
        sub = word[:i + 1]
        if sub in dictionary:
          root = sub
          break
      replacements.append(root)
    return " ".join(replacements)
```

## Solution: Trie

```python
class Solution:
  def replaceWords(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:

    trie = {}

    words = sentence.split()

    # Convert dictionary into trie
    for root in dictionary:
      currentTree = trie
      for char in root:
        if char not in currentTree:
          currentTree[char] = {}
        currentTree = currentTree[char]
      currentTree['*'] = ''

    replacements = []

    for word in words:
      currentTree = trie
      result = ''
      for char in word:
        if char in currentTree:
          result += char
          currentTree = currentTree[char]
          if '*' in currentTree:
            break
        else:
          break
      replacements.append(result if '*' in currentTree else word)

    return " ".join(replacements)
```
