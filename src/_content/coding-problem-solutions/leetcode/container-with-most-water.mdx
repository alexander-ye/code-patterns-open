## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the _maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Constraints**

- `n == height.length`
- <code>
    2 {"<="} n {"<="} 10<sup>5</sup>
  </code>
- <code>
    0 {"<="} height[i] {"<="} 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

## Solution: Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
  def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
      max_area = 0

      for i in range(len(height) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(height)):
          width = j - i
          our_height = min(height[i], height[j])
          area = width * our_height
          max_area = max(area, max_area)

      return max_area
```

## Solution: Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
  def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
    i = 0
    j = len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while i != j:
      width = j - i
      our_height = min(height[i], height[j])
      area = width * our_height
      max_area = max(area, max_area)
      if height[i] < height[j]:
        i += 1
      else:
        j -= 1

    return max_area
```
