## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` is a **palindrome**, and false otherwise.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same forward and backward.

For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

_Follow up_: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

**Constraints**

<code>
  -2<sup>31</sup> {"<="} x {"<="} 2<sup>31</sup>-1
</code>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
    stringify = str(x)
    str_len = len(stringify)
    num_indices_to_check = str_len // 2
    for i in range(num_indices_to_check):
      if stringify[i] != stringify[-i-1]:
          return False
    return True
```
