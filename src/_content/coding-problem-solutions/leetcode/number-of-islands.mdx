## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Constraints**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'`

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    # Initialize return value
    num_islands = 0

    # Recursive dfs function that marks visited islands
    # Once we find a chunk of land, recursively mark the entire island
    def markIsland(grid, row, col):
      # If indices fall out of baounds OR we don't find land, don't do anything
      if row < 0 or row >= len(grid) or col < 0 or col >= len(grid[0]) or grid[row][col] != '1':
          return
      # Replace all adjacent land with '#' (marking island in place prevents counting the island more than once)
      grid[row][col] = '#'
      markIsland(grid, row - 1, col)
      markIsland(grid, row + 1, col)
      markIsland(grid, row, col - 1)
      markIsland(grid, row, col + 1)

    for i in range(len(grid)):
      for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        # If we find land
        if grid[i][j] == '1':
          # Increase count of islands we found
          markIsland(grid, i, j)
          # Mark entire island to prevent overcounting
          num_islands += 1
  
    return num_islands
```
