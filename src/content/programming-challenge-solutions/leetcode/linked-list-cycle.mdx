## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Constraints**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>
    -10<sup>5</sup> {"<="} Node.val {"<="} 10<sup>5</sup>
  </code>
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Solution: Set

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
  def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    visitedNodes = set()

    currentNode = head

    while currentNode:
      if currentNode not in visitedNodes:
        visitedNodes.add(currentNode)
        currentNode = currentNode.next
      else:
        return True

    return False
```

## Solution: Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
  def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
      if slow == fast:
        return True
    return False
```
