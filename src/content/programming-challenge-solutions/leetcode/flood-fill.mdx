## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

An image is represented by an `m x n` integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. You should perform a **flood fill** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `color`.

_Return the modified image after performing the flood fill._


**Constraints**

- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- <code>0 {'<='} image[i][j], color < 2<sup>16</sup></code>
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`


<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    starting_color = image[sr][sc]

    # If the old color is the same as the new color, we return the image as is
    # Prevent unnecessary work, prevent infinite recursion
    if starting_color == color:
      return image

    # Recursive function
    def fillCell(image, r, c, old_color, new_color):
      num_rows = len(image)
      num_cols = len(image[0])

      # In Python, we can use empty return statements that serve as early exits from functions
      # Similar to "breaks" in loops

      # If our parameteres fall outside the bounds of our grid
      if r < 0 or r >= num_rows:
        return
      if c < 0 or c >= num_cols:
        return
      # If the current pixel color is not the same as the pixel we previously looked at
      if image[r][c] != old_color:
        return

      # If we are in an adjacent cell in the grid and the color is the same as the old color
      # Fill the pixel in with the new color
      image[r][c] = new_color

      # Recursive call to the top, botttom, right, and left pixels
      fillCell(image, r - 1, c, old_color, new_color)
      fillCell(image, r + 1, c, old_color, new_color)
      fillCell(image, r, c + 1, old_color, new_color)
      fillCell(image, r, c - 1, old_color, new_color)

    # Initial call to fillCell on starting row/starging column pixel
    fillCell(image, sr, sc, starting_color, color)

    # Return the image after completing modifications
    return image
