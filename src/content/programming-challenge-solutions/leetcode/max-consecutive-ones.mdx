## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array_.

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} nums.length {"<="} 10<sup>5</sup>
  </code>
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

</details>
</blockquote>

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    maxConsecutives = 0
    currentConsecutives = 0
    for i in nums:
      if i == 1:
        currentConsecutives += 1
      else:
        if currentConsecutives > maxConsecutives:
          maxConsecutives = currentConsecutives
        currentConsecutives = 0
    if currentConsecutives > maxConsecutives:
      maxConsecutives = currentConsecutives
    return maxConsecutives
```
