## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} nums.length {"<="} 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>
- <code>
    100 {"<="} nums[i] {"<="} 100
  </code>
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    num_uniques = 1
    current_unique_index = 0

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
      if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
        current_unique_index += 1
        nums[current_unique_index] = nums[i]
        num_uniques += 1

    return num_uniques
```
