## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

(A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.)

**Constraints**

- <code>
    0 {"<="} s.length {"<="} 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>

- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Solution: Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
  def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    stringLength = len(s)
    if stringLength < 2:
      return stringLength
    longestSubstringFoundLen = 1
    # Brute force
    for i in range(stringLength):
      substring = set()
      for j in range(i, stringLength):
        if s[j] in substring:
          break
        substring.add(s[j])
      uniqueSubstringLength = len(substring)
      if uniqueSubstringLength > longestSubstringFoundLen:
        longestSubstringFoundLen = uniqueSubstringLength
    return longestSubstringFoundLen

```
