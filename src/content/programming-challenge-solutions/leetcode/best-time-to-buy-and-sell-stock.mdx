## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<super>th</super></code> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Constraints**

- <code>
    1 {"<="} prices.length {"<="} 10<sup>5</sup>
  </code>
- <code>
    0 {"<="} prices[i] {"<="} 10<sup>4</sup>
  </code>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    min_price = prices[0]
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
      price = prices[i]
      max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
      min_price = min(min_price, price)
    return max(0, max_profit)
```
