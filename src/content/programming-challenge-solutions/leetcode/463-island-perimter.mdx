## Problem Statement

<blockquote src={frontmatter.src_url}>

You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.


**Constraints**

- `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- There is exactly one island is `grid`.

<summary><strong>Example Test Cases</strong></summary>

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  # There are various ways to approach the arithmetic logic in the problem

  def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    perimeter = 0
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0])

    # Traverse every pixel, referencing them as grid[i][j], where i is a row and j is a column
    # For every row
    for i in range(num_rows):
      # For every column
      for j in range(num_cols):
          # If our pixel is land
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
          # If pixel to the top falls out of bounds or is water
          if i - 1 < 0 or grid[i - 1][j] == 0:
            perimeter += 1
          # If pixel to the bottom falls out of bounds or is water
          if i + 1 >= num_rows or grid[i + 1][j] == 0:
            perimeter += 1
          # If pixel to the left falls out of bounds or is water
          if j - 1 < 0 or grid[i][j - 1] == 0:
            perimeter += 1
          # If pixel to the right falls out of bounds or is water
          if j + 1 >= num_cols or grid[i][j + 1] == 0:
            perimeter += 1
    return perimeter
