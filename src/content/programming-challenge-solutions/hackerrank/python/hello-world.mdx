## Problem Statement

<blockquote>
Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
```

The above code will print `Hello, World!` on your screen.

### Input Format

You do not need to read any input in this challenge.

## Solution

Well, this problem seems straightforward enough.

We can implement this following HackerRank's suggested steps:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Initialize a variable to store our string
    my_string = "Hello, World!"
    # Print the string we stored
    print(my_string)
```

Or we can just:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Epic job!
