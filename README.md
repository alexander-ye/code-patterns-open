# Code Patterns Open

An open-source resource that covers solutions to technical screening programming challenges.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

We use `npm` as our package manager.

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### VSCode Settings
Be sure to add this to your `settings.json`:
```
  "[markdown]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  }
```
Otherwise your markdown files&mdash;specifically your code blocks&mdash;will be improperly auto-formatted.
