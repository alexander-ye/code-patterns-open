# Code Patterns Open
An open-source resource that covers solutions to technical screening programming challenges.

## Contributors
We use `npm` as our package manager.

### VSCode Settings
Be sure to add this to your `settings.json`:
```
  "[markdown]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  }
```
Otherwise your markdown files&mdash;specifically your code blocks&mdash;will be improperly auto-formatted.

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

### Core Versioning Requirements
Astro version `v2.9.3`
npm version `v9.5.1`
node version `v18.16.0`

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [...]
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [...].astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [...].mdx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [...].astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [...].astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro, as we've configured it, looks for `.astro`, `.jsx`/`.tsx`, or `.md`/`.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
